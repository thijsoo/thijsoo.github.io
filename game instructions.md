# Yoast SEO Brick Breaker Game Design Plan (PixiJS)

## Overview
Create a classic brick breaker game using **PixiJS** with a Yoast SEO brand theme. The game features:

- Player paddle controlled by keyboard input.
- Ball that bounces and breaks bricks.
- Bricks colored with Yoast SEO brand palette.
- Score tracking, lives, and game states.

---

## Core Gameplay Elements

### Player Paddle
- Moves horizontally left/right using arrow keys or A/D.
- Constrained within the game canvas boundaries.
- Styled with Yoast brand colors (orange #FF6F00 or purple #5B2E91).
- Rectangle or sprite representation.

### Ball
- Starts positioned on the paddle.
- Launches on spacebar press with an initial velocity.
- Moves with constant speed, bouncing off walls, paddle, and bricks.
- Bounce angle varies based on contact point on paddle.
- Detects collisions with bricks and paddle.

### Bricks
- Arranged in grid (rows x columns) near top of canvas.
- Colors cycle through Yoast palette:
    - Orange: #FF6F00
    - Purple: #5B2E91
    - White or light gray for contrast.
- Break and disappear when hit by the ball.

### Scoring and Lives
- Score increases per brick destroyed.
- Player starts with limited lives (e.g., 3).
- Losing the ball below paddle deducts a life.
- Ball resets on life lost.
- Game over screen when no lives left.

---

## UI/UX Design
- Use Yoast brand colors for UI elements.
- Display score (top-left) and lives (top-right).
- Start screen with title, instructions, and prompt to launch (spacebar).
- Game over screen with final score and restart option.
- Clean and minimal aesthetic consistent with Yoast branding.
- Optional simple sound effects triggered on events.

---

## Controls
- **Left/Right Arrow** or **A/D** keys for paddle movement.
- **Spacebar** to launch ball and restart game.

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **Game Application (Main)**
    - Initializes PixiJS application and contains main game loop.
    - Holds game states: Start, Playing, Game Over.
2. **Paddle (Sprite or Graphics)**
    - Keyboard-controlled horizontal movement.
    - Collision boundary for ball bounce.
3. **Ball (Graphics or Sprite)**
    - Handles motion, bouncing, and collision detection.
    - Resets on life lost.
4. **Brick (Graphics or Sprite)**
    - Static sprites arranged in a grid.
    - Destroyed on ball collision.
5. **UI Text**
    - Displays Score and Lives using PIXI.Text.
    - Displays start and game over messages.

---

## Key Functions and Logic

- **Input handling** for paddle movement and ball launch.
- **Collision detection** between ball and paddle, ball and bricks, ball and canvas bounds.
- **Physics** for ball bounce angle and speed.
- **Brick grid generation** with colors cycling through Yoast palette.
- **Score and life management.**
- **Game state transitions:** start → playing → game over → restart.

---

## Development Milestones

1. **Setup PixiJS Application**
    - Create canvas and initialize renderer.
    - Setup game loop and ticker.

2. **Paddle Creation and Movement**
    - Draw paddle.
    - Add keyboard controls.
    - Clamp paddle inside canvas boundaries.

3. **Ball Initialization and Movement**
    - Create ball graphic.
    - Handle launch, motion, and bouncing off walls.

4. **Collision with Paddle and Bricks**
    - Detect collision with paddle (adjust ball angle by hit position).
    - Detect collision with bricks to remove them and increment score.

5. **Brick Layout**
    - Create brick grid with Yoast brand colors.

6. **Score, Lives, and UI**
    - Track and display score and lives.
    - Reset on life lost.
    - Implement start and game over screens.

7. **Polish**
    - Add sound effects.
    - Add visual effects (simple particle or glow).
    - Responsive scaling if needed.

## Yoast Brand Colors

| Color Name | Hex      | RGB       |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Orange     | #FF6F00  | (255,111,0)  |
| Purple     | #5B2E91  | (91,46,145)  |
| White      | #FFFFFF  | (255,255,255)|

Use these colors mainly for bricks, paddle, UI text highlights, and backgrounds to keep consistent branding.

## Example Snippet Idea (For GitHub Copilot):

```javascript
// Create paddle
const paddle = new PIXI.Graphics();
paddle.beginFill(0xFF6F00); // Yoast Orange
paddle.drawRect(0, 0, 100, 20);
paddle.endFill();
paddle.x = app.renderer.width / 2 - 50;
paddle.y = app.renderer.height - 50;
app.stage.addChild(paddle);

// Paddle movement logic (keyboard events)
// Ball creation and collision detection
